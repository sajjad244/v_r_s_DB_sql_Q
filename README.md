## 📖 Overview

The **Vehicle Rental System** is a structured database system designed to manage **users, vehicles, and bookings** efficiently.  
It demonstrates real-world database management concepts including:

- Designing **ERD with 1:1, 1:N, N:1 relationships**
- Proper use of **Primary Keys (PK)** and **Foreign Keys (FK)**
- Writing **complex SQL queries** using `JOIN`, `EXISTS`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`

This project is perfect for learning database design and query optimization in a practical scenario.

## 🛠 SQL Queries

### Query 1: JOIN

Retrieve booking information along with customer and vehicle names.

```sql
SELECT
    b.id AS booking_id,
    u.name AS customer_name,
    v.name AS vehicle_name,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.status,
    b.total_cost
FROM Bookings b
INNER JOIN Users u ON b.user_id = u.id
INNER JOIN Vehicles v ON b.vehicle_id = v.id;
```
